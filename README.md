# 🧠 Machine Learning – Implementations From Scratch & with Scikit-learn

This repository aims to gather implementations of various Machine Learning models, both **from scratch** (without using high-level libraries) and using **Scikit-learn**, to better understand how these algorithms work internally and how to apply them in practice.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand Machine Learning algorithms by building them step by step (e.g., gradient descent, normal equation, etc.).
- Compare performance and behavior between manual implementations and Scikit-learn versions.
- Practice developing well-structured, reproducible, and well-documented ML projects.
